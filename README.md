## Description

You may work in any framework you would like.

Work on the exercise is time-boxed to three hours.

It is quite likely you will not have time to provide a solution that meets the full set of requirements.

Prioritize completion of working, tested, extensible, well-designed code over a complete solution.

## Background:

Business has developed an exciting new idea for an application to help shelters find adoptive homes
for their dogs. You've been assigned to make the first pass on the front end of the application.

## Prototype:

The team has provided the following requirements for the first release:

- Login page
- Dashboard with a list of breeds
  - Each item in the list should have the breed’s name, details, and link to available dogs
  - Design needs to match the attached mockup
- Details pages with all available dogs per breed
- Ability to add new dog
- Ability to edit existing dog
- The same header on all pages
- The header on pages that the user is logged in with will contain this message: "Hello, {first name}"

The back-end will be worked on at the same time as the front-end, so during development and for
testing you will need to mock the endpoints described in the API spec.

Top priorities are the breed dashboard and the “available dogs” pages. If time permits, determine the
order of additional tasks with an eye toward providing maximum usability of the prototype.
